          correct_feedback: "<p>It is essential that you remain calm during any situation and avoid doing or saying anything that implies you are asking them to leave the vehicle. Act in a confident manner and keep your behaviour in proportion to the provocation. You should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>think about your approach;</li>\r\n\t<li>be aware of warning signs and think ahead;</li>\r\n\t<li>show that you are willing to listen;</li>\r\n\t<li>avoid body language that could inflame the situation, such as pointing of fingers; and</li>\r\n\t<li>inform the school and your company of any persistent problems.</li>\r\n</ul>"

        question_4:
          correct_answer: q4_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Smoking in a taxi</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislation was introduced in April 2007 in Northern Ireland concerning smoking in certain vehicles, this includes smoking in taxis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law requires:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>any enclosed vehicle used by members of the public, including taxis, to be smoke-free. This means that neither the driver nor the passenger can smoke in a taxi; and</li>\r\n\t<li>taxi vehicles MUST be smoke-free AT ALL TIMES even if there are no passengers in the vehicle or if the vehicle is being driven by a person other than the registered owner/driver, or when the vehicle is being used for personal business by either the registered owner/driver or any other person.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, you MUST NOT smoke in public transport vehicles or in vehicles used for work purposes. You MUST also display, in a prominent position, no-smoking signs and ensure that you are aware of, and adhere to, all the legal restrictions relating to the type of vehicle you drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to comply with the legislation can be reported to the Environmental Health Department who will carry out an investigation and any taxi driver who fails to prevent someone smoking in their vehicle can be prosecuted and fined up to a maximum of £2,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone found smoking in a taxi can be issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice or be prosecuted and face a fine of up to a maximum of £1,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to display the correct signage can result in a fixed penalty notice of £200 and if prosecuted carries a fine of up to £1,000.<br />\r\nFurther information can be found at www.dhsspsni.gov.uk or www.smokefree.nhs.uk</p>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "All you need to know to become a Taxi Driver". Section 3. Limits and Regulations.</p>'
        question_5:
          correct_answer: q5_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Ramp and wheelchair fittings</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have the facility to carry wheelchairs you must ensure that you’re able to correctly load and secure the wheelchair so that the passenger can be transported safely and then reverse the process at the end of the journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To load the wheelchair user you should</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>prepare for your passenger. Fit the wheelchair restraint and make space available for the wheelchair. Ensure the door is fully opened and secured. Pull out the ramp and add an extension if necessary</li>\r\n\t<li>push the wheelchair user into the vehicle and stow the ramp.
