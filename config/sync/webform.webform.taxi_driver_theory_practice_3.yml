        question_2:
          correct_answer: q2_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>Don’t drive for too long without taking a break. Your concentration will be much better if you plan regular stops for rest and refreshments. It’s recommended that you take a break of at least 15 minutes after every two hours of driving. This is especially important at night.</p>'

          correct_feedback: '<p>If you’re taking medicine or drugs prescribed by your doctor, check to ensure that they won’t make you drowsy. If you forget to ask when you’re at the surgery, check with your pharmacist.</p>'
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Highway Code for NI". Rule 96.</p>'
        question_4:
          correct_answer: q4_a1
          correct_feedback: "<p>Proteins are essential components of diet but are not needed in vast quantities by adults, although their presence makes for slow digestion and prolonged satisfaction after eating. However, care is needed to ensure that you do not eat excessive amounts of foods such as eggs and cheese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protein-based foods should be included as part of a healthy eating plan. However, eating them in large quantities can add extra unnecessary fat or salt to your diet, which can contribute to an increase in cholesterol levels. Recommended protein portion sizes vary according to sources, but a general approximation of a single portion would be any one of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>4 oz (100 g) meat, fish or poultry;</li>\r\n\t<li>approximately 1 oz (30 g) of hard cheese or nuts; and</li>\r\n\t<li>two whole eggs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Many traditional ways of serving proteins, such as frying, battering and cooking in pies and puddings can add unnecessary calories. Any fats added should be unsaturated ones, such as sunflower and olive oils or products such as spreads manufactured from them.</p>"

        question_5:
          correct_answer: q5_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Fire extinguishers</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>All taxis MUST carry at least one fire extinguisher. It MUST be serviceable and carried in an easy accessible location on the vehicle.<br />\r\nRegulations specify the type and size of fire extinguisher that MUST be carried on your vehicle. You should be able to recognise the various types of fire extinguisher and know which fires they are intended to tackle. For example, it is dangerous to tackle a fuel fire (flammable liquid) with a water or carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, since this may only spread the fire further. Each extinguisher will have a coloured label or badge relevant to its content.</p>"

          correct_answer: q10_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Tyre pressure</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can’t guess pressures just by looking at a tyre, except when it’s obviously flat. Check your tyres regularly – at least once a week. Use a reliable gauge and follow the vehicle handbook for the correct tyre pressure. Check your tyres and adjust the pressure when they’re cold. Don’t forget the spare tyre and remember to refit the valve caps. The handbook will also tell you if you need different pressures for different conditions. Generally, the pressure should be higher for a heavily loaded vehicle or if you’re intending to drive at high speed for a long distance, e.g. motorway journeys.</p>"
