      answers:
        question_1:
          correct_answer: q1_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>The STOP sign is the only road sign that is octagonal. This is so that it can be recognised and obeyed even if it is obscured, for example by snow.</p>'
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 6, Traffic Signs.</p>'
        question_2:
          correct_answer: q2_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Defensive driving</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Take extra care if your path crosses or joins the path of other road users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check your mirrors, particularly for cyclists and motorcyclists, when turning at junctions. They can approach very quickly from behind and are less easy to see than a larger vehicle.</p>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 8, Junctions.</p>'
        question_3:
          correct_answer: q3_a
          correct_feedback: '<p>If you know which light is going to show next you can plan your approach accordingly. This can help prevent excessive braking or hesitation at the junction.</p>'
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 6, Traffic Signs.</p>'
        question_4:
          correct_answer: q4_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>Traffic signs can be divided into three classes. Those giving orders, those warning and those informing. Warning signs are usually triangular and direction signs are generally rectangular. One notable exception to this is the octagonal ‘STOP’ sign.</p>'
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 6, Traffic Signs.</p>'
        question_5:
          correct_answer: q5_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Pelican crossings</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>These are light-controlled crossings where the pedestrian uses push-button controls to control the traffic. They have no red and<br />\r\namber phase before the green. Instead they have a flashing amber light, which means you must give way to pedestrians on the crossing but if it’s clear you can go on. The crossing area is shown by studs and a ‘stop’ line marks the place for drivers to stop when it’s necessary.</p>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Highway Code for NI". Rule 196.</p>'
        question_6:
          correct_answer: q6_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Pedestrians and cyclists</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>give way to pedestrians already crossing when you turn – they have priority</li>\r\n\t<li>keep a special lookout for cyclists coming up on your left</li>\r\n\t<li>take special care when crossing a cycle track, bus or cycle lane</li>\r\n\t<li>hold back and allow a cyclist to clear the junction before you turn, don’t overtake and then cut in on them.</li>\r\n</ul>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 8, Junctions.</p>'
        question_7:
          correct_answer: q7_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Overheating</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The probable causes of overheating could be any of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fan belt snapped</li>\r\n\t<li>Hose leaking</li>\r\n\t<li>Fuse blown on electric</li>\r\n\t<li>Cooling fan</li>\r\n</ul>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 14, Basic maintainance.</p>'
        question_8:
          correct_answer: q8_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>Keep a safe distance – there could be queues in front.</p>'
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Highway Code for NI".</p>'
        question_9:
          correct_answer: q9_a1
          correct_feedback: "<p>Some warning lights if they remain on must be checked out immediately – Oil, Seatbelt, and Airbag etc. If possible you should stop somewhere safe and convenient and try to find the cause. You should also check your vehicle’s handbook for further information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others such as the Particulate Filter warning light advise that action is required, but not necessarily immediately. If this light is illuminated it means that the particulate filer is upwards of 45% blocked with the soot residue from the burnt fuel from the engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the make and model of your vehicle there are a number of actions you can take to extinguish this light. One such example is to drive your vehicle for a short time on higher than normal speed roads, such as a motorway, where the exhaust temperature can be raised sufficiently to burn off the residue which should extinguish the light. You should however consult your vehicle’s handbook for the appropriate action for your type of vehicle.</p>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "All you need to know to become a Taxi Driver". Section 2. Your vehicle.</p>'
        question_10:
          correct_answer: q10_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>The lights that control the crossing show to both directions of traffic. If a pedestrian from either side is still crossing when the amber light is flashing, you must wait.</p>'
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Highway Code for NI". Rule 196 - 198.</p>'
        question_11:
          correct_answer: q11_a1
          correct_feedback: "<p>Ensuring that daily walk-round checks are carried out will enable you to find any defects that could become a problem and cause the vehicle to break down or be driven while illegal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time taken to complete a thorough check will be less than that required to organise repair or replacement while out on the road. Checks need to be made before you start up the vehicle or begin a journey. The consequences are too great to risk driving a vehicle with defective parts.</p>"
