          correct_feedback: '<p>Neglecting the maintenance of vital controls and fluids such as brakes, steering and lubricants is dangerous; they need to be checked regularly. Having your vehicle serviced according to its maintenance schedule helps the engine work more efficiently, thereby saving fuel and reducing the effect on the environment by cutting emissions. Causing excessive smoke is an offence, and also contributes to the possibility of causing an incident or collision. If you notice thick black smoke coming from the exhaust, stop in a safe place and get help.</p>'
