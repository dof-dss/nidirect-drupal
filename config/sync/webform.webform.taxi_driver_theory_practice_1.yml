        question_1:
          correct_answer: q1_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>Neglecting the maintenance of vital controls and fluids such as brakes, steering and lubricants is dangerous; they need to be checked regularly. Having your vehicle serviced according to its maintenance schedule helps the engine work more efficiently, thereby saving fuel and reducing the effect on the environment by cutting emissions. Causing excessive smoke is an offence, and also contributes to the possibility of causing an incident or collision. If you notice thick black smoke coming from the exhaust, stop in a safe place and get help.</p>'

        question_2:
          correct_answer: q2_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Road positioning</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You should normally keep to the left when driving. However, keep clear of parked vehicles, leaving room for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>doors opening</li>\r\n\t<li>vehicles moving off</li>\r\n\t<li>children running out</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Don’t</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>drive too close to the kerb, particularly in streets crowded with pedestrians</li>\r\n\t<li>weave in and out between parked vehicles. It’s unnecessary and confusing to other drivers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When necessary, ease over to the left to</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>help the flow of traffic</li>\r\n\t<li>let a faster vehicle overtake.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>The correct position</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You should always be in the correct position for the route you’re going to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Keep to the left if you’re going straight ahead or turning left.</li>\r\n\t<li>Keep as close to the centre of the road as is safe when you’re turning right.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Your position is important not only for safety, but also to allow the free flow of traffic. A badly positioned vehicle can hold up traffic in either direction.</p>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 7, On the Road.</p>'
        question_3:
          correct_answer: q3_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>Don’t remove a motorcyclist’s helmet unless it’s essential to do so; for example, if they’re having breathing difficulties.</p>'
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 16, Incidents, accidents and emergencies. The Highway Code for NI</p>'
        question_4:
          correct_answer: q4_a4
          correct_feedback: '<p>These are the areas behind and to either side of you which are not covered by your mirrors. You should always check these areas before moving off.</p>'

        question_5:
          correct_answer: q5_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Parking at night</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Cars can park without lights on roads with a speed limit of 30 mph<br />\r\n(48 km/h) or less. They must comply with any parking restrictions, and not park within 15 metres (50 feet) of a junction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They must also be parked parallel to, and close to, the side of the road or in a designated parking place and facing in the direction of the traffic flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have to park on any other road, you should never</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>leave your vehicle without side or parking lights unless a sign indicates that lights aren’t required. It would be better to get it off the road altogether</li>\r\n\t<li>leave your vehicle standing on the right-hand side of the road, except in a one-way street.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Always switch your headlights off when you stop, even for a short while. It’s an offence to leave them on when the vehicle is parked. The fixed glare can be very dazzling especially if, for any reason, the vehicle is on the offside of the road facing oncoming traffic. Leaving lights on can also use up the battery.</p>"
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Highway Code for NI". Rule 248 - 250.</p>'
        question_6:
          correct_answer: q6_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Anticipation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Anticipation in driving means planning well ahead and acting promptly to deal with the changes going on around you. It should, with experience, become almost an automatic reaction. It’s the hallmark of a good driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to continually question the actions of other road users.<br />\r\nIf you plan ahead and try to anticipate the actions of others, you can</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>avoid being taken by surprise</li>\r\n\t<li>prevent some hazards developing</li>\r\n\t<li>save fuel by anticipating situations early so that you can plan your approach and therefore keep moving when it’s safe to do so</li>\r\n\t<li>take early evasive action with regard to those hazards that do develop.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Anticipation and good planning are essential to developing defensive driving techniques</p>"

        question_7:
          correct_answer: q7_a1
          correct_feedback: "<p>Transport is an essential part of modern life, but we can’t ignore its environmental consequences – local, regional and global. There’s increasing public concern for the protection of our environment, with the result that many motor manufacturers are devoting more time, effort and resources to the development of environmentally friendly vehicles. But you, as a driver, can also help. If you follow the principles of ecosafe driving, you’ll become a more environmentally friendly driver and</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>your journeys will be more comfortable</li>\r\n\t<li>you could considerably reduce your fuel bills</li>\r\n\t<li>you could reduce those emissions that cause damage to the atmosphere.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, you’ll become a safer driver as you develop your planning, perception and anticipation skills to a high level. Try to drive in an ecosafe manner at all times, whether you’re driving for business or pleasure. Fuel, like all forms of power, costs money as well as having an impact on the environment. Minimising the fuel or power you use is always important, both for the planet and for your pocket. However, although it’s good to save fuel, you mustn’t compromise the safety of yourself or other road users when attempting to do so. Road safety is more important than saving fuel. At all times you should be prepared to adapt to changing conditions and it may be that you have to sacrifice fuel-saving for safety.</p>"

          correct_answer: q8_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Selecting gears</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s not always necessary to change up or down through each gear; it’s possible to miss out intermediate gears (this is known as ‘block’ gear changing). It helps to reduce the amount of time you’re accelerating, and as this is when fuel consumption is at its highest, it will help you to save fuel. As soon as conditions allow, use the highest gear possible without making the engine struggle.</p>"

        question_10:
          correct_answer: q10_a1
          correct_feedback: "<h4>Catalytic converters</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>These are exhaust treatment systems which remove up to 75% of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons. The converter is a honeycomb-shaped filter with a total surface area about equal to a football pitch. This surface is coated with precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. These speed up a chemical reaction in the exhaust gases as the engine heats up. The oxygen content of the exhaust is monitored and a sensor triggers controls to adjust the air–fuel mixture. The converter only deals with toxic and polluting gases. Carbon dioxide is still produced. Leaded petrol can’t be used in vehicles fitted with a catalytic converter. Even one tankful can permanently damage the system. If you over-accelerate or exceed 3000 rpm the catalytic converter can’t clean up emissions completely, and will release some that are contaminated. Make sure therefore that you don’t drive in such a way that this will occur.</p>"

          correct_feedback: '<p>Make sure you know how many seats your vehicle is licensed for and DO NOT exceed that number under any circumstances as you may be putting both your passengers and your safety at risk. If you are faced with a situation where you have more passengers than you are legally licensed to carry you should offer your passengers the option of waiting for an alternative vehicle that can carry everyone or arrange to leave a passenger or passengers behind until alternative transport can be arranged. You cannot refuse to take at least some of the passengers as you have an obligation to complete the hire.</p>'

          correct_feedback: "<h4>Mobile phones and radio communication equipment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It is illegal to operate a hand-held mobile phone or similar device while driving. No driver should use a mobile communication device while in control of a moving vehicle. Never use a hand-held microphone or similar device while driving. You should always find a safe and convenient place to stop before using such equipment.<br />\r\nIf your taxi is fitted with a communications radio or telephone, you should only use it while driving if it is fitted with a hands-free microphone. However, even using hands-free equipment is likely to distract your attention from the road. It is far safer not to use any such equipment or to try to tune the radio while driving.</p>"
