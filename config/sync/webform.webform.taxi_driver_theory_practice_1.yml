        <p><strong>Please carefully read the following scenario and then answer questions 11 to 15 which follow.</strong></p>

        <p>You drive a taxi licensed to carry four passengers. You are in the middle of a 12 hour shift and you get a call from the office to pick up some passengers from a local night club. On the way, you come across traffic lights that have stopped working. There is a police officer standing facing you controlling the traffic and signalling you to go ahead. When you get to the night club there are five passengers one of whom is in a wheelchair. On the way back to the office via the motorway, you get a call on the taxi radio which does not have a hands free facility. The controller asks if you would consider staying on for an extra couple of hours. You have yet to complete the compulsory module of taxi periodic training.</p>

Having your vehicle serviced according to its maintenance schedule helps the engine work more efficiently, thereby saving fuel and reducing the effect on the environment by cutting emissions.

            <h4>Road positioning</h4>

            <p>You should normally keep to the left when driving. However, keep clear of parked vehicles, leaving room for:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>doors opening</li>
            	<li>vehicles moving off</li>
            	<li>children running out</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Don’t</h4>

            <ul>
            	<li>drive too close to the kerb, particularly in streets crowded with pedestrians</li>
            	<li>weave in and out between parked vehicles. It’s unnecessary and confusing to other drivers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When necessary, ease over to the left to</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>help the flow of traffic</li>
            	<li>let a faster vehicle overtake.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The correct position</h4>

            <p>You should always be in the correct position for the route you’re going to take.</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>Keep to the left if you’re going straight ahead or turning left.</li>
            	<li>Keep as close to the centre of the road as is safe when you’re turning right.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your position is important not only for safety, but also to allow the free flow of traffic. A badly positioned vehicle can hold up traffic in either direction.</p>
