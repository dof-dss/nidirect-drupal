// Layouts
//
// The layout styling for major parts of the page are created 'mobile-first' using flexbox and grid. Limited fallbacks
// declaring appropriate fallback's where the technology is not widely enough implemented in currently used web
// browsers. We utilise auto-prefixer to help in this regard to ensure that when prefixing for a declaration is required
// for a particular vendor that the developer need not be concerned with making sure this is done.
//
// NOTE: if you want to use CSS grid in an IE-friendly way, you should only use it in scenarios where the the number of
// columns and rows is known and grid items can then be placed explicitly (IE does not support auto-placement of items).
// Using grid areas also works well in IE where grid items are specifically placed in a specific grid area.
//
// As NICS has comparatively few variations in layouts, therefore layouts can be covered with relatively little code.
// This section of the styleguide is essentially broken into 2 main areas - common classes and utilities that are
// required and used for layout, then there are a series of individual layouts.

// Container
//
// `.container` defines a simple wrapper class that permits the associated tag to fill the width of the page until it
// reaches a maximum width (defined by the `$max-grid-width` variable in init/variables. When the container reaches
// the max-width, it is centered on the page. All other layout structures should be nested inside this centered layout
// to ensure that content does not get too wide on very large screens. Note that `.grid` class which indicates the start
// of a grid container can be applied at the same level as `.container`, the grid will not be able to stretch beyond
// the maximum width of the container.
//
// Weight: -1
//
// Style guide: layouts.common.container

.container {
  padding: 0 15px;
  @include breakpoint($tab) {
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: $max-grid-width;
    padding: 0 20px;
  }

  &--no-padding {
    padding: 0;
  }
}

// Grid
//
// `.grid` defines a simple wrapper class that establishes a cssgrid by declaring `display: grid;`. The grid will take
// the maximum amount of available space available to the element. A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one
// or more child elements. For NICS purposes the behaviour of the child elements is described by the individual layout
// more on that later in the guide. The space between child elements is described by the grid-gap attribute which we
// assign to a variable `$grid-gap`. The gap can be set to none by applying the modifier class `.no-gutter` to the
// parent grid element.
//
// Weight: -1
//
// Style guide: layouts.common.grid
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-column-gap: $grid-gap;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: min-content; // IE fix. Use min-content instead of auto.

  &.no-gutter {
    grid-column-gap: 0;
  }
}

// Grid areas
//
// `.ga-*` class can be applied to child elements in a `.grid` to define grid-area's when using cssgrid. It is not
// necessary a requirement to add a `.ga*` class to each of the child elements after a grid is established each will be
// placed in the next available grid row / column. However by adding one of these classes it helps with providing
// appropriate fallbacks and hopefully helps understanding the intentions of where a child element should be in the grid.
//
// Weight: -1
//
// Style guide: layouts.common.grid-areas

// Grid area full
//
// `.ga-full` class can be applied to child elements in a `.grid` to set the child element to have the full available
// width of the parent grid space.
//
// Weight: -1
//
// Style guide: layouts.common.grid-areas

.ga-full {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  // needed for the floated layout
  float: left;
  clear: both;
  width: 100%;
}

// Disable fallback widths on grid items for browsers that can support css grid.
// sass-lint:disable no-important
@supports (display: grid) {
  .grid > * {
    width: auto !important;
  }
}

// IE fix.
@media all and (-ms-high-contrast: none), (-ms-high-contrast: active) {
  // Disable fallback widths set on grid items for IE11 which has partial support for grid.
  .grid > * {
    // sass-lint:disable no-important
    width: 100% !important;
  }
}
